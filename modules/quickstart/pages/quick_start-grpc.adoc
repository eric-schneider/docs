= Stargate gRPC API QuickStart

*Time to complete: 5 minutes*

// LLP - REWRITE FOR GRPC
// INCLUDE EXAMPLES WITH BLOOMRPC

Stargate is a data gateway deployed between client applications and a database.
In this QuickStart, you'll be up and running on your local machine with the
gRPC API plugin that exposes ???

== Using the Auth API to generate an auth token
In order to use the Stargate Document API, an authorization token must be
generated to access the interface. A REST API token is used for this purpose.

// generate the auth token
include::secure:partial$gen_auth_token.adoc[]

You will need to add this token to the GraphQL Playground in order to authorize
your GraphQL requests. Copy the value after `"authToken"` to use later.

// using GraphQL Playground
include::develop:page$using-graphql-playground.adoc[]

// using Postman
include::develop:page$tooling.adoc[tag=UsingPostman]

== Creating schema

In order to use the GraphQL API, you must create schema that defines the keyspace and
tables that will store the data. A keyspace is a container for which a
`replication factor` defines the number of data replicas the database will store.
Tables consist of columns that have a defined data type. Multiple tables are contained
in a keyspace, but a table cannot be contained in multiple keyspaces.

// create namespace
include::develop:page$dev-with-graphql-cql-first.adoc[tag=CreateKS]

// create collection
include::develop:page$dev-with-graphql-cql-first.adoc[tag=CreateTable]

// check NS and collections exist
include::develop:page$dev-with-graphql-cql-first.adoc[tag=CheckKS]
include::develop:page$dev-with-graphql-cql-first.adoc[tag=CheckTables]

== Interacting with tables

// API generation
include::develop:page$dev-with-graphql-cql-first.adoc[tag=APIGeneration]

// write document data
include::develop:page$dev-with-graphql-cql-first.adoc[tag=WriteData]

// read document data
include::develop:page$dev-with-graphql-cql-first.adoc[tag=ReadData]

// update document data
include::develop:page$dev-with-graphql-cql-first.adoc[tag=UpdateData]

// delete document data
include::develop:page$dev-with-graphql-cql-first.adoc[tag=DeleteData]
